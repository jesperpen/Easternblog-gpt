# The Eastern Blog – Project Guide

This file is a brief guide for AI assistants (Codex) working on this repository.

- No SPA frameworks: the site is static HTML, CSS and small vanilla JS.
- Global styles live in `assets/css/main.css`.
- Shared header and footer are duplicated across HTML files and should stay visually consistent.
- Use Exo 2 as the primary font.
- Keep the design brutalist-inspired, with grey backgrounds and simple, strong typography.
- Sights, countries and categories follow the conceptual data model described in the main ChatGPT conversation.
- When adding or editing pages, reuse existing classes and design tokens.

For detailed behaviour, ask the user for the latest instructions and treat this repository as the source of truth.
